  name = "AllDebrid"

  [debrider.auth_infos]
    username = "valid-username"
    password = "valid-password"
    base_url = "https://alldebrid.com"

[providers]
  # Provider config key and feed provider key must be the same
  [providers.DirectDownload]
    # If specified, favorite_hosts will be looked for in the provider links.
    # If none of them are found, nothing will be downloaded.
    # If not specified, the first link available is downloaded.
    favorite_hosts = ["uploaded.net", "rapidgator.net"]

[webserver]

## Supported services

Here is a complete list of all supported services.

Do not hesitate to write a PR to add more.

### Providers

- DirectDownload (`provider = "DirectDownload" # or dd, directdownload, directdownload.tv`)

### Debriders

- AllDebrid (`name = "AllDebrid" # or alldebrid, Alldebrid, ad`)

### Downloaders

- Aria2 (`name = "aria2" # or Aria2, aria`)

## Docker

You can run Christopher with Docker with the following command:

```shell
# First build the image
docker build -t christopher .

# As a command line debrider
docker run -v $HOME/.config/christopher/config.toml:/christopher/config.toml:ro christopher debrid "http://rapidgator.net/file/HTGAWM.mkv"
```

In order to download files, you must give the christopher container access
to a Downloader.

Looking at the `docker-compose.yml` file, you will see a basic example of a
working christopher + aria2 setup. Try it with `docker-compose up`.

Remember that you need to update your christopher config file with the right
aria2 RPC token and use `http://aria2:6800/jsonrpc` as the ` rpcURL`.
